# Switch-Actuators System
A system I made for Unity consisting of Switches that when they get activated, they activate Actuators which do actions.

It also includes a "CompositeSwitch" which contains a list of switches so it only activates when all the switches are active, like a AND gate.


There's also a simplified version on a branch (**simplified-activables**) that only uses one base class. Some testing is required to determine which one is better and easier to use.
